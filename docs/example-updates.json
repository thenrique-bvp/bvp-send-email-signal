MBI offers modular banking infrastructure, empowering your institution to activate your existing data like never before. You provide the data, we supply the tools. Together, we build towards the future. MBI began in 2018 as HMBradley, a consumer fintech specializing in elevated digital banking services designed for a modern customer. HMBradley offered a customer-centric platform rewarding consumers for their habits not just the money in their account, offering competitive annual-yield percentage, and best-in-class customer servicing program; raising over $70M in capital along the way. Too nimble to settle for expensive legacy vendors and products stagnated by an aging infrastructure, the team at HMBradley built its own backend infrastructure with an eye towards versatility and modularity to accommodate the increasing customer demand. Talking with Financial Institutions helped us realize we had cracked a code: Our modular banking infrastructure connected disparate data sources, allowing us to build and launch products, and make changes to our system, in real time, without the need to replace clunky and expensive legacy cores. At MBI, we are committed to making your financial institution's data work for you. Our experience stems from creating banking architecture from the ground up, guided by a customer-centric, first-principles approach. You'll benefit from years of experiments and innovation. Together, we can shape the future of banking."

							"Hey there, welcome to Locusive. If you've ever navigated the maze of a SaaS tool and wished for a quicker way to find answers, or if you're a CSM feeling the weight of endless queries, we see you. We've been there too. We've seen time and again how important it is to service customers quickly, effectively, and accurately. Most businesses struggle to get customers everything they want and need when they ask for it. CSMs spin their wheels with data pulls, engineers that should be working on product have to come up with quick queries, and there's no time to service the long-tail of smaller customers that are all trying to gain value from your business or product. That's where the idea for Locusive was born. Our goal is to create an AI assistant that feels like a guide or concierge for your business. For users, it's about streamlining those moments of \"how do I...?\" and turning them into \"oh, that's how!\". And for the CSMs, it's about filtering out the noise, letting you focus on the deeper, more strategic aspects of your role. We're on a journey to blend technology with a bit of that human touch, making the digital space feel a tad more navigable and friendly. Interested in the evolving landscape of customer success and AI's role in it? Check us out at locusive.com."

If you're tired of wasting time with data retrieval and analysis, or you just want to learn more about how AI can help you find the information you need: Send us a DM. We're always happy to answer questions."

							"Whale handles the end-to-end process of collecting, managing, and returning security deposits for landlords while ensuring compliance with state and local regulations. It’s free for landlords, and renters love it. Here’s how it works: 1) Instead of paying their landlord directly, a new resident funds their Whale deposit account online via ACH transfer. 2) The deposit remain locked in their account for the duration of their lease, but they earn monthly interest on their full account balance while having full visibility into their money. 3) When it’s time to moves out, the landlord tells Whale how much to deduct for move-out charges. Whale then immediately transfers this amount to the landlord’s operating account and unlocks the resident’s deposit in their account, allowing them to get their money back faster.

							"FlexCharge is an AI-driven platform that partners with merchants and payment providers to instantly review and recover failed customer transactions at no risk to the merchant and at no cost to the consumer. The problem we tackle: Digital commerce still has a big payment problem with 5-25% of transactions declined in an on-line shopping experience, representing +$500bn of lost sales. Worse, 50-75% of shoppers will move on to another store or drop their purchase after a first payment decline. Existing solutions only partially address the problem: Current solutions only offer marginal gains. Payment orchestration, offering multiple payment options, fraud detection platforms, and tokenization strategies all help, but have limited results and only use limited information. Most services address fraud, but not other decline codes representing over 75% of overall declines such as Funds not Available and Do Not Honor. The FlexCharge approach: Our platform offers the widest coverage and the least friction possible for a merchant. 100% of declined codes are covered using a fully embedded, real-time, and white-labeled solution. We take full liability for any transaction that is rescued by our service and settle merchants even if we have not recovered the funds from the customer, who is charged the transaction amount at no extra cost. The outcome: Up to +15% increase in revenues. On average, 30-50% of declined transactions are prevented by FlexCharge, leading to increased sales, decreased cost of acquisition, and longer lifetime customer values. The Team: A US Company with R&D based in Israel, FlexCharge brings together a highly experienced team representing the best of Quantitative Analytics, Risk Management, and Payments backgrounds to tackle declined payments and help your business sell more."

In July 2022, alt.bank launched novücard, a credit card for anyone who wants to be in responsible control of their finances. Since its Beta launch, novücard has strengthened its position as the country's fastest growing direct credit card issuer. The card has numerous exclusive benefits: - Dynamic credit: it is the first card in Brazil to offer a dynamic credit limit, which automatically increases from month to month as invoices are paid on time. - Cofrinhü: the money stored in Cofrinhü becomes a credit limit and yields 100% of the CDI. - Credit back: it is also the first card in Brazil in which the customer receives a R$ 1 increase in the limit back for every R$ 100 spent and paid on the invoice. - Local discounts: network of partners offering exclusive discounts for novücard customers. In the management of alt.bank and novücard are great professionals in their areas of activity in Latin America: - Brad Liebmann, Founder & CEO - https://www.linkedin.com/in/liebmann/ - Fabio Silva, COO -https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabiosilvaamin/ - Javier Mancilla, Head of Intelligent Systems (Machine Learning) -https://www.linkedin.com/in/mancillamontero/ - Gustavo Busnardo, CTO - https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavobusnardo/ We serve our clients through more than 100 employees working from home or based in São Paulo/SP and São Carlos/SP.
